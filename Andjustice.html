  <p tabindex="0" class="center blue5">Metallica's <i>'...And Justice for All'</i> stands as a monumental and unapologetically heavy masterpiece in the world of thrash metal. Released in 1988, this album is a relentless sonic assault that combines intricate songwriting with technically impressive musicianship. The title track alone is a <i>near 10-minute progressive metal epic</i>, showcasing the band's ability to craft intricate arrangements while maintaining their signature aggression.
  <br><br>Following the unfortunate demise of Metallica's bassist, Cliff Burton, in 1986, the band took a bizarre approach to the mix of their next album - <i>completely silencing the bass track of their new bassist, Jason Newsted.</i>
  <br><br>While the lack of any sort of bassline in the album is a sore spot for many fans, this album remains a classic for its searing guitar work, relentless drumming, and James Hetfield's raw, powerful vocals. Tracks like 'One' and 'Blackened' exemplify Metallica's ability to blend melody with unrelenting intensity.</p>
