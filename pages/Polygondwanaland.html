  <h2 tabindex="0" class="blue5">Review</h2>
  <p tabindex="0" class="center blue5">King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard, oftentimes called the chameleons of the rock world, are named so because of their incredibly diverse output of albums. As of September, 2023, they have released 24 studio albums. <i>Polygondwanaland</i> is their 12th album, and the fourth of the five albums they released on 2017.
  <br><br>From the moment you press play, you're transported into a kaleidoscopic sonic landscape that seamlessly weaves together elements of prog, folk, and even hints of Middle Eastern and African influences. The album's intricate compositions are a testament to the band's virtuosity, with complex time signatures and layered instrumentation that demand repeated listens to fully appreciate. I've personally listened to the whole album over 30 times in its entirety, and I haven't grown sick of it.
  <br><br>One of the unique quirks this album has is its <i>free</i> nature. That is, this album is completely free for the public to download, share, and even press their own vinyl copies of the album, making it a true gift to the music community.</p>
