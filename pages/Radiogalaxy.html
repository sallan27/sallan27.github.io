  <h2 tabindex="0" class="blue5">Review:</h2>
  <p tabindex="0" class="center blue5">Starcadian's <i>'Radio Galaxy'</i> is a cosmic sonic voyage that beckons listeners to strap in and take flight. Released in 2021, this album is a shining beacon in the synthwave and retro-futuristic music genre.
  <br><br>Radio Galaxy is a captivating blend of neon-soaked nostalgia and futuristic soundscapes. Starcadian's mastery of electronic production is on full display, creating a sonic experience that feels like a journey through time and space, all framed through the lens of a radio show being hosted in space!
  <br><br>What sets this album apart is its ability to evoke a sense of nostalgia for a future that never wasâ€”a futuristic vision filtered through the lens of '80s and '90s pop culture. The result is an album that feels both familiar and entirely new.</p>
